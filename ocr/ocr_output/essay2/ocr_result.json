I'm interested in English and hope to be an interpreter in future. Naturally it's very important for me to learn English well. As every body knows vocabulary is an important part of language, just like bricks in a building. I usually memorize twenty new words a day and put them to use when ever possible. After class. I often listen to English programs on TV and on the radio. Besides. I've learned a lot from the Internet and other sources. Now I'd like r to make some suggestions on English teaching and learning in our school. Firstly, we should be given more opportunities to use whart we've learned in order to have a better grasp of it.Secondly. I hope our teachers can recommend more interesting books and magazines and give us more free time to read them. Finally, I suggest we have more English activities, such as English contests and festivals. Thank you for listening.",
